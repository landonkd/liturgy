## Remarks

What must it have been like, sitting down at the bottom of the empty cistern that Joseph was thrown in? How long did he wait there, and what thoughts haunted him? Was he afraid? Did he recognize the anger and hatred in his brothers’ eyes as they cast him down, or did this exile catch him by surprise?

And when they drew him out of the cistern and haggled his value with the Midianite traders, what did he think of the price they fixed? Or as he was carted off to Egypt, did he feel the pang you feel when you know you will never see home again? Rabbi David Fohrman suggests Joseph did not, in fact, feel this fear, saying that his assumption would more likely have been that his dad (Jacob) would surely come looking for him and arrange his return. He was, after all, the favorite son. But, as Forhrman further points out, the key piece of information that Joseph is never given is the story his brothers told his father. Joseph does not know that the brothers took his coat, dipped it in blood, and led his father to believe he was dead.

Joseph thinks there is a chance of rescue, but Jacob is not coming. And so Joseph sits in Egypt, waiting. And waiting. How long before his hope for a loving redemption finally shrivels to nothing?

Joseph’s stay in Egypt is a roller-coaster experience. One moment, incredible blessing, the next, falsely accused and tossed in a dungeon. One moment, favor with the prison guard and a position of authority, the next, forgotten by the cupbearer who swore to help you. Until one day he is pulled out of the dungeon by Pharaoh, much the same way he had long hoped to be pulled out of the cistern by his father. Pharaoh showers him with the affection he had received from his father all those years ago. And I wonder, as Pharaoh puts a royal ring on his finger and slips the finest, colored robes on Joseph, does he instinctively flash back to the coat of many colors that his own father gave him, the firm and affirming touch of a father’s hand on the shoulder?

Whatever hope Joseph might have had left for Jacob to come for him — if it still persisted at all — may very well have mutated into an acceptance of a new identity, a new role, and a new father figure in his life. Whatever story God had originally intended now seems to have been for naught.

But then one day, years later, Joseph’s brothers show up looking for aid. Through the course of his conversation, he learns that his father is still alive and that he never knew the truth of Joseph’s demise. Is this invigorating or distressing? Probably both, but either way, it is certainly disrupting. Consider Joseph’s life at this point: He is successful and powerful and rooted in a clear role and identity in Egypt. He has found his groove.

But is this who he was truly meant to be?

Suddenly, Joseph must decide who his true father is. He must decide who he is. Which narrative will have his allegiance? Will it be given to the powerful empire, or will he choose the narrative of a small band of wandering shepherds with a destiny in Canaan?

It reminds me of Peter’s story in the Gospel of John. While his circumstances were different, Peter still has his own moment where he loses hope. We know this one. In a fit of denial, he turns in his disciple card and goes back to fishing. But Jesus shows up on a beach, much like Jacob showing up in Egypt, to confront Peter with his true story. And the question for Peter will not be one of fathers and opportunities, but whether he allows himself to believe in a story of Kingdom again, or if he will judge himself unworthy.

## Response

1. Is there anything in your life that you have given up hope for?
2. Is there a part of who you are that previously felt like it was a part of something more beautiful? Is there an identity you once had — grounded in hope, resurrection, and God — that went away?
3. Do you know of anyone in your life who has gone through this crisis — who used to think they were somebody in Christ, but gave up on that dream?
4. Is there anything in this group that needs to be reclaimed today? Don’t expect something from every person, but maybe one person or one story in the group needs your attention. Pray over and put energy and resources behind chasing down that story. This is what resurrection can look like.
